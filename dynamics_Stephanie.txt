https://github.com/pixelatinate/List-Based-Sort.git

I wrote the code for merge.cpp and also fixed the List.cpp so that it properly created the linked lists. I also created the benchmarking files list10.txt .... list10M.txt. I also made the table in the README, although we were each responsible for entering the time the memory for the sorts we did. 
Carter wrote the code for quicksort and also was a big help with trouble shooting. 
Katie wrote the code for stl sort. 
Swasti wrote the code for qsort and was also a big help with trouble shooting and setting up the repository. 

It was a bit stressful working in a group because it required having to trust that the other members in the group would get done what they were supposed to and leave us with enough time to test and troubleshoot the project. It was also a little confusing making sure we were pulling and pushing the correct stuff, which on a few occasions, caused problems.
